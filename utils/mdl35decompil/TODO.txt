Critical:
- Fix for UV on BorealisWorker and child_worker_f1
- Add flexes
- Skins

Optional:
- Transitions (numtransitions in studio.h)
- For whatever reason bones with parent "-1" not compiling by standart studiomdl
- Make LODs
- Make poseparameters
- Make physmodels
- 37: Check for .mdl in name (to disable shit like this: $modelname "Combine_Elite.mdl.mdl")
- Work on 37 decompilation

Fixed:
- Fixed initial model rotation (rotate Y by 90 deg)
	- Also, only static props needs this rotation (by 2R1Zt)
- Added ACT_'s
- Controller types
- "snap" $sequence parameter
- Blend rules
- Decmpiling old world weapon models (that are pistols)
